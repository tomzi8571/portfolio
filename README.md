# Portfolio

This is my portfolio showcasing my professional development.

I created this project out of pure curiosity, while I was continuing my professional development in different front and backend technologies. In this project I mostly relied on React, Vite, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI and integrated it into the Github Actions workflow to automate and highlight security and dependency issues and automatically create pull requests to fix those. I also leveraged the github deployment workflow to publish it on github pages. I also got to research and integrate SVG badges and images for my skills that where provided by open source projects.

I learned a lot during this process and Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for the hundreds of thousands of person-hours contributed by open-source developers that made this project possible.
